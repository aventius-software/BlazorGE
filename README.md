# BlazorGE

Blazor Game Engine - hence BlazorGE (pronounced like 'Blay' 'Zorj'?), is a basic experimentation with a game engine (or more like a framework really) using Blazor. Currently we're going for something simple but modern, starting with 2D style stuff first - maybe might add some 3D stuff later. Trying to use standard design patterns 
and use dependency injection (where appropriate).

This is just a fun project to experiment with Blazor and simple game design. Highly influenced by David Guida's Blazor 
game development series https://www.davidguida.net/blazor-and-2d-game-development-part-1-intro/ and bits of 
Monogame https://www.monogame.net/ and Monogame.Extended https://www.monogameextended.net/ 

Feel free to fork, submit pull requests, log issues or request/suggest features etc...

P.S. Make sure you have the latest Visual Studio 2022 version or you may get compile/runtime errors (currently requires .NET 7)

Current features:-

1) ECS (Entity Component System) design - sort of done
2) Asset loading - graphics done
3) Sprites - done
4) Easy to use - hopefully
5) Keyboard and mouse input, maybe touch eventually - keyboard done
6) Game screens (e.g. title, main game play etc...) - done
7) Basic canvas implementation - done
8) Several simple example games implementing all features - a few bits of part games
9) Any other suggestions?

Stuff to be done and/or improved

1) Better ECS system ;-)
2) Sprite animation
3) More/better demo games
4) More canvas methods
5) Better Blazor JS interop
6) Sound
